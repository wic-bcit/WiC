                  Hello Everyone!
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  We are a student run club at BCIT. This club was started by a group of like-minded individuals who wanted to create a safe space for the female students in Computing programs at BCIT.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Our club's main goal is to Empower women in a male-dominated industry, Promote women in Computing, and Connect students with female professionals in the Vancouver Tech Industry.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  We host events and collabrate with local companies to bring tips & tricks and networking opportunities to our club members.
                  Such as, Meet and Greets, Resume & Cover Letter Mini Panels and Game Nights.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  We welcome all students that support our goals and want to create a safe space for like-minded people.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Please email us if you have any inquires. Thank you!
