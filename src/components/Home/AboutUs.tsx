          Hello Everyone!
          <br /> <br />
          We are a student run club at BCIT. This club was started by a group of
          like-minded individuals who wanted to create a safe space for the
          female students in Computing programs at BCIT.
          <br />
          <br />
          Our club's main goal is to Empower women in a male-dominated industry,
          Promote women in Computing, and Connect students with female
          professionals in the Vancouver Tech Industry.
          <br /> <br />
          We host events and collabrate with local companies to bring tips &
          tricks and networking opportunities to our club members. Such as, Meet
          and Greets, Resume & Cover Letter Mini Panels and Game Nights.
          <br /> <br />
          We welcome all students that support our goals and want to create a
          safe space for like-minded people. Please email us if you have any
          inquires.
          <br /> <br />
          Thank you!
        </p>
